Variance, initiate a **Defense Logic Audit** focusing on **Capital Efficiency**.

**Status:**
You are currently optimized to "defend" challenged positions by rolling for credits and inverting strangles to reduce cost basis. You view this as "mechanical success" as long as the trade stays alive.

**The Mission:**
I want you to analyze the conflict between **"Defending the Trade"** and **"Optimizing the Portfolio."**
Sometimes, "fixing" a trade ties up massive Buying Power (BPR) for months, creating a "Zombie Position" that starves the rest of the account of capital.

**The Challenge:**
Propose a **NEW Concept or Metric** that tells me when a position has become a **"Capital Tumor"**—technically alive/repairable, but mathematically toxic to hold due to Opportunity Cost.

* **Constraint:** Do not use simple P/L (emotional). Use **Time**, **BPR (Buying Power)**, and **Expected Return**.
* **Focus:** Look at the **Diminishing Returns of Rolling**.

**Ask yourself:** *At what precise mathematical point does a "Repair Strategy" become less efficient than taking a loss and deploying that capital into a new trade?*

**Output your finding as:**
1.  **The Concept Name** (Make it iconic/clinical, e.g., "The Zombie Ratio").
2.  **The Math/Logic** (The formula: How do we compare the Roll Yield vs. Portfolio Average?).
3.  **The Visualization** (How does it look in the HUD? Use ASCII/Unicode).
4.  **The "Why"** (Why does this save us from the "Sunk Cost Fallacy"?).
